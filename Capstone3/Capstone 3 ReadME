Problem Identification

The Question: Can we develop a model that will accurately predict whether a myocaridal infarction patient is a high risk of a cardiac complication during the hospitalization.

The Audience: The results will be presented to the Hospitalist service of the local community hospital.

The Data: The Dataset was downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data was collected in the Krasnoyarsk Interdistrict Clinical Hospital No20 named after I. S. Berzon (Russia) in 1992-1995.  It includes over 124 features representing patient healthcare data.

The Modeling Response: Cardiac Complication Patients = 1, Non-Cardiac Complication Patients = 0

The Model: Random Forest with a Recall score of 65% and ROC AUC score of 79%

The Deliverables: Jupyter notebooks of data wrangling through modeling, a final report, and a presentation
